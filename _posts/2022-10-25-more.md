More is more.

Not better and not progress. More is *more*.

It's an easy default to act on instead of asking subjective and difficult questions such as:
- Am I spending my time doing the things I care about?
- Am I searching for more because I don't know what else to do?
- Why do I feel like I'd be "falling behind" if I didn't chase more?

The seduction of chasing more is that it's a default. Of *course* you should chase more money. Of *course* you should chase career progression. Of *course* building status is important.

And don't get me wrong, these are all important. But when does "more" become "enough"?

"Enough" is a target, but more as a default is often unsustainable. It's a moving goalpost which doesn't lead to contentment, only dissatisfaction.

It's so, *so* tempting to say yes to that next thing, because doing more feels natural. But it doesn't have to be. It's a choice, even if it's your current default.

What if I made a different choice? What if the goal wasn't to default to more, but to choose more strategically in a few domains, while being okay that everything else is "enough"?

I don't know the answers to these questions. But I can clearly see that they are important enough to be asking them regularly.
