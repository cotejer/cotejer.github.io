# Jeremy Côté

## In four words

Physicist, [writer](https://cotejer.github.io), [cartoonist](https://handwaving.github.io), runner.

## Currently

Starting my PhD in physics at the Université de Sherbrooke, writing about physics on my [blog](https://cotejer.github.io), and making comics about science with [Handwaving](https://handwaving.github.io). My goal is to illuminate the various aspects of physics with my writing/cartooning, including being part of academia.


## Research interests

Quantum computing, error correction, and machine learning in quantum many-body physics. During my undergraduate degree, I studied modified gravity, but I decided to move into the field of quantum computing and machine learning because I wanted to learn more about computational methods in physics. For my PhD, quantum computing and information will be my focus.
